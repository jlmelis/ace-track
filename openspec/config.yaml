# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
context: |
  Tech stack: React 19, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript
  Domain: AceTrack Volleyball - A local-first PWA for tracking volleyball matches and stats
  State Management: React local state with IndexedDB (via db.ts) for persistence, no external state libraries
  Styling: Tailwind CSS strictly. Uses a brand color palette (e.g. brand-primary, brand-neutral). Use Lucide-react for icons.
  Components: Functional components (React.FC) with explicit interface props.
  Architecture: Code in /components (UI) and /views (Pages), /db.ts for storage, /types.ts for interfaces.
  Important: The app must function as an offline-first PWA, relying on sw.js and IndexedDB.

# Per-artifact rules
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
rules:
  spec:
    - Prefer native browser implementations (IndexedDB, Web Workers) where applicable over third-party libraries.
    - Ensure new UI components follow the brand's Tailwind aesthetic (bold text, clean layouts).
  tasks:
    - Ensure task breakdowns include testing offline capabilities if data models change.
    - Break tasks into chunks no larger than 2 hours of implementation.
